 suffered or incurred by any person, and whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise.
 (b)         Other than the Consumer Guarantees, 4EE excludes all warranties, conditions or other terms, whether implied by statute or otherwise including, without limitation, all representations or warranties, either express or implied, about content contained on the App or services provided to you through the App for any purpose (including representations about the accuracy, currency, completeness or suitability of the information published on the App).
 (c)          Except for liability under the Consumer Guarantees, 4EE excludes liability for all Losses suffered or incurred by any person:
 (i)          in connection with or in any way relating to the App, including any disruption to the App or interference with or damage to computer systems or other electronic devices; or
 (ii)         in connection with any errors, omissions or inaccuracies contained in any information published on the App, including Losses in connection with your reliance on information obtained through the App; and
 (iii)        otherwise under or in connection with these Additional Terms.
 (d)         Except for liability under the Consumer Guarantees, to the extent that 4EE is unable to exclude its liability under this clause 2.2, 4EE limits its liability, at 4EE' option and to the maximum extent permitted by law, to:
 (i)          resupplying the services or equivalent services; or
 (ii)         paying the cost of having the services or equivalent services resupplied.
  
  
 2.3        Indemnity
 (a)         You indemnify 4EE and each of its directors, officers, employees, agents, advisers, consultants and contractors (collectively, Indemnified Persons) against all Losses arising from or relating to:
 (i)          your use of the App;
 (ii)         your breach of these Additional Terms or breach of law;
 (iii)        your breach of any Third-Party Terms; or
 (iv)        any claim alleging that you have infringed the intellectual property or other rights of any person.
 (b)         If any Indemnified Person suffers or incurs any Loss as a result of your breach of these Additional Terms or other act or omission and 4EE would have been able to recover those Losses if the Losses were suffered or incurred by 4EE, then 4EE will be able to recover those Losses as if those Losses were suffered or incurred by 4EE.
  
 3.           General
 ​
 3.1        Changes to Additional Terms
 4EE may change these Additional Terms at any time. You agree to be bound by the changed terms if you continue to use the App after the terms have changed.
 3.2        Severability
 If any part of these Additional Terms is held to be invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, that part will be severed, and the remaining parts of these Additional Terms will continue in force.
 3.3        Governing law
 These terms are governed by the laws applicable in the State of Victoria, Australia and you submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of that State.
